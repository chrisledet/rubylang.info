## RubyLang.info

RubyLang.info was a community driven web site, dedicated to helping both new and experienced Ruby 
developers.

### Contributing

  The setup is very straightforward. Only [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is required to get started.

  1) Install Jekyll by running
  
      gem install jekyll
    
  2) Run `jekyll --server` in the source code directory. This will start Webrick, generate the static files, and will
  watch for any changes. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the site.

  Note: For styling, we are currently using [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) but looking to migrate over
  to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in the near future. Both are very similar and if you're familiar with any, 
  you'll have an easy time changing the stylesheets. Stylus can be install using node + npm. More documentation on
  this is coming soon.
  
  3) Once you've made changes and you're satisfied, just push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request.
